Dear Diary,

My first project is about to conclude. How time flies! I have learned so much during the past 3 months and it's time to consolidate my learnings. I created my repository on GitHub today to push myself to update regularly.

Data science in production is so different from school! It took me so long to refactor my jupyter notebooks for reporting into code package for production, not to say the necessary functions for production: error throwing, logging and testing. I suppose being a developer is part of being a data scientist.

It is Friday and I don't feel like working on next week's tasks in the afternoon. Perfect time to tidy up my thoughts :satisfied: Hope I will write to you at least every week!

Dear Diary,

It has been an intensive week of debugging. Integration requires massive amount of energy and concentration. I am a bit tired of checking every nook and cranny for possible variable name mismatches. Time to think about the structure for my personal guide as a refreshment!

I have dug out the helpful resources for reference. I should spare time every week to go through some really well-structured guides. Always good to learn something new!
