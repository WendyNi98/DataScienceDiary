# Data Science Diary
As I am just starting my career in data science, I would like to keep a repository of the workflow, resources and tips to learn from my experiences.


The choice of useful resources and tips would be very personal based on my practical needs. However, please feel free to suggest, reference or distribute. It would be great if this repository can serve as a directory for data science in production.
